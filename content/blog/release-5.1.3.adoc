The KiCad project is proud to announce the latest series 5 stable
release of KiCad.  The 5.1.3 stable version contains critical bug
fixes and other minor improvements since the 5.1.2 release.  It
also includes improved footprint, symbol, and 3D model libraries,
translations, and documentation.  A list of all of the fixed bugs
since the 5.1.2 release can be found on the

This release contains several critical bug fixes so please consider

Packages for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are available or will be

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.
