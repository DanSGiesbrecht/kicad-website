The KiCad project is proud to announce the latest stable release of
KiCad.  Version 5.1.0 is a first for KiCad in that it is the first
time the project has release a minor stable release version.  This
release is primarily to resolve legacy canvas rendering issues on
Linux when http://wxwidgets.org/[wxWidgets] is built against version
3 of https://www.gtk.org/[GTK].  This release does not contain any
new editing features but there have been many important changes that
make this release a substantial improvement over the 5.0 series.

- Cairo canvas is now used for printing support on all platforms.
- Schematic editor rendering now uses the modern canvases.
- Pcbnew scripting support for Python 3 has been added.
- Significant user interface improvements.
- Dialog box improvements.
- Both the footprint and symbol library editors now share the same
  user interface paradigm.
- Symbol, footprint, and 3D model library improvements.
- Documentation and translation improvements.

Of course no new stable version of KiCad would be complete without
https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0-rc2[many],
https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.1.0[many] bug fixes so please
consider upgrading as soon as possible.  This version will be
the only supported version of KiCad moving forward.  There will
be no further releases of the 5.0 series.

Version 5.1.0 is built from the source code in the
link:https://git.launchpad.net/kicad/log/?h=5.1[lp:kicad/5.1]
branch.

KiCad binaries will be available for download for Windows, MacOS, and
Linux are available or will be in the very near future.  See the
link:/download[KiCad download page] for guidance.

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.
We hope you enjoy the latest release of KiCad.
